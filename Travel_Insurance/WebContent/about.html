          <p>By taking out travel insurance you are essentially covering yourself against travel risks such as lost or stolen luggage, cancellation cover (should you not be able to travel due to unexpected medical reasons) and most importantly, unexpected medical costs abroad.What happens if someone gets sick and can not travel, a parent dies, you are required to work, or your house floods?
             With trip cancellation coverage, you will be able to recover your out-of-pocket expenses for these covered reasons and more.You have planned a cruise but you discover the connecting flight to get to the ship is delayed. With the missed connection it looks like you will miss your cruise departure. How will you catch up to the ship?</p>
          <img src="images/page2_img1.jpg" alt="" class="img_inner img_fright wow zoomInRight">
          <p>With missed connection coverage, you can take another flight to catch the ship at the next port-of-call. We will also have assistance services to help you arrange and pay for those travel changes. </p>
          <p>After attending the family reunion, you arrive at the airport to return home and are told tornadoes have cancelled all flights. Who will help you find a new flight to return home? First off this is not insurance for liability while you are driving your car. If you are involved in an accident or accidentally cause damage and are held accountable for it, insurance can cover your liability and legal expenses.</p>

        </div>
        With trip interruption coverage, you will have the money to refund the expenses of a new return ticket or to stay in a comfortable hotel. We are providing insurance for loss of any baggage or passport reported within 48 hours of occurrence. When any luggage or passport is lost then that person become tensed.

	In many situations, some provides the insurance when the total baggage of insurer is lost but we are providing the insurance when any valuable item in the baggage is stolen or lost or any other items are lost based on their value and the policy of insurer.
	In many cases, the insurer who is taking our insurance policy and has any pre-existing health issues can get the insurance based on his policy. As we are providing the medical insurance for emergency conditions, likewise the insurer can take the benefit if he has some pre-existing health issues. Terms & conditions applied.
