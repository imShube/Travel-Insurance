  <center><h1>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h1></center>

<Strong>1. Our Agreement With You</Strong><br>

 
<p align="justify">
We sell a variety of travel related products from different suppliers and service providers
. Each Supplier has its own terms and condition that are applicable to your 
particular arrangements in addition to our general terms and conditions, and you should 
make sure you understand them. Certain software and content found on our website are owned 
or licensed by us or our Suppliers, your use of which may be subject to further conditions.</p>
<p align="justify">
All airlines tickets are subject to supplemental price increases that may be imposed 
after the date of purchase. Post-purchase price increases may be applied due to 
additional costs imposed by a supplier or government. You may be charged additional
sums by STA Travel to offset increased fees, fuel surcharges, taxes, and fluctuations
in foreign exchange markets or any combination thereof. Acceptance of these terms 
and conditions hereby consent you to any post-purchase price increases and authorize 
STA Travel to charge my credit card for such additional amounts.</p>

<Strong>Deposits and Payment</Strong>
<p align="justify">
Any deposits from you are non-refundable. Payment of a deposit enables us to hold
a reservation for you but does not guarantee the price. The price can only be 
guaranteed once we receive full payment and other travel documents have been issued,
subject to any terms and conditions of the Supplier. We will advise you of the date 
that full payment is required. Upon your provision of your payment information, you are 
authorizing us to make the payment arrangements with the corresponding Suppliers.</p>
<p align="justify">
We reserve the right to refuse personal checks as a method of payment. After full payment,
the conditions of the contract with your Supplier may permit them to increase the cost of
your arrangements. If we are acting as your Booking Agent, we will pass on any such increase
to you as we become aware of such increase. If we have arranged a package, changes in 
transportation costs including the cost of fuel, taxes, fees and exchange rates mean that
the price of your travel arrangements may change after you have paid in full.</p>

<strong>Documentation</strong>
<p align="justify">
Our general practice is to send documents to our customers electronically whenever 
possible. We reserve the right to charge an administration fee should you make a request
for such documents to be sent as a hard copy.</p>

<strong>Cancellations and Changes</strong>
<p align="justify">
Your contract with your Suppliers may allow them to cancel or amend bookings. If we are 
your Booking Agent, we will ensure that you are promptly notified of any significant 
changes once we become aware of such change if there is time before your departure, 
but we accept no liability for any changes or costs incurred that may result. Subject 
to the Supplier’s terms and conditions, you will then have the choice of accepting the 
change of arrangements, accepting an offer of alternative travel arrangements if one is 
made available by the Supplier, or canceling your booked arrangements and receiving any
applicable refunds. We do not guaranty that any refunds will apply.</p>
<p align="justify">
If you have booked a flight and we are alerted to a significant schedule change by your
airline before you leave the United States, we will contact you by email to advise you 
of this. Please ensure that you have given your contact email address to us and that you 
regularly check for messages before you leave. We have no control over airline schedule 
changes and accept no liability for costs which may arise as a result of such changes.</p>
<p align="justify">
After you have left the US, it is your responsibility to check with the airline that 
any onward flights you have confirmed are operating as booked. We strongly recommend
that you contact your airline at least 72 hours before the scheduled departure of 
each flight to do this. Please note that for some airlines it is mandatory to confirm 
with them your intention to fly.</p>


<Strong>2. Your Agreement With Us</Strong>
<Strong>
Your Acceptance of these Terms and Conditions</Strong>
<p align="justify">
By booking your arrangement with us or using our website, you are agreeing to be bound
by the terms of this Agreement, including Parts 1-3 of this Agreement and any additional
terms and conditions of any Supplier that are applicable to your booking, travel arrangements
or use of any website content. You agree on behalf of yourself and those you represent to 
comply with all such terms and conditions, including the payment of all amounts when due. 
You agree that any violation of any such terms and conditions may result in (a) the cancellation 
of your reservation or purchase, (b) your forfeiture of any monies paid for your reservation or
purchase, (c) you being denied access to the applicable travel related product or service, and 
(d) our right to debit your account for any costs we incur as a result of such violation.<p>
<p align="justify">
You represent and warrant that (a) you are of sufficient age to use our services and website 
and can create binding legal obligations in connection with your use, (b) you are legally 
authorized to act on behalf of those you represent and accept these terms and conditions
on their behalf, and (c) the information supplied by you or members of your group is true
and correct. You are responsible for informing such other persons of all terms and conditions
applicable to their travel arrangements. You understand that you are financially responsible 
for any use of our services or website by you and those using your name or account.<p>

<strong>If You Change Your Booking</strong>
<p align="justify">
Where a change requested by you to your travel arrangements is permitted and possible, our 
standard service fees will apply in addition to any additional Supplier charges. Please 
contact your original booking agent to enquire about changes or review the ‘Travel Help’ 
section of www.statravel.com for details of how to request changes. Please note that all 
reservation changes are subject to availability and the terms and conditions of the product
purchased.</p>
<p align="justify">
Changes to name details are not allowed by many airlines and other Suppliers. While we will
endeavor make such a change if necessary, please bear in mind that most airlines and Suppliers 
treat a name change as a cancellation, to which standard conditions and charges would apply.</p>
<p align="justify">
Flights must be taken in the sequence they appear on your ticket or eticket confirmation. 
If you plan not to take a flight as booked, please contact the airline as far in advance as 
possible to discuss your options. If you do not check in on time for a confirmed reservation, 
the airline may register you as a ‘no-show’, which could result in extra charges and/or your 
whole flight itinerary being cancelled and/or render your ticket void.</p>

<strong>If You Cancel Your Booking</strong>
<p align="justify">
If you cancel your arrangements, you may be entitled to a partial refund. In addition to the 
cancellation terms and conditions of your Supplier(s), our standard fees will apply as may be 
outlined on your receipt or booking confirmation. We need to receive from you your original 
voucher before any applicable refund can be considered. If you decide to cancel arrangements 
before the balance due date, any deposits paid are non-refundable.</p>
<p align="justify">
Refunds will only be paid to you once we have received the funds back from the Supplier(s).
Generally flight tickets cannot be refunded if they are partially used. We are not responsible
for a Supplier’s failure to pay a refund.</p>
<p align="justify">
If the reason for your cancellation is covered under the terms of your travel insurance policy,
you may be able to reclaim your cancellation charges through your insurer.</p>

<strong>Important Notice Regarding Airline Reservations</strong>
<p align="justify">
If you arrive at an airline ticket or passenger check-in counter with your confirmed ticket and 
find that the airline shows no reservation for you – do not leave the counter. Check your ticket. 
If the status box shows "OK" for the flight in question, the airline policies typically require 
them to accommodate you on that flight, or if that is not possible, they must either find you a 
substitute flight or pay you denied boarding compensation. If necessary ask to speak to a supervisor.</p>

<strong>Travel Documents and Destinations</strong>
<p align="justify">
It is your responsibility to ensure that all of the details on your travel documents are 
correct and to bring to our attention any errors or discrepancies immediately. Your travel
Documents are valuable and should be safeguarded as if they were cash. It is not always 
possible to replace travel documents in the case of loss, theft, damage, etc.</p>
 
<strong>Passport, Visa and Immigration Requirements</strong>
<p align="justify">
It is your responsibility to fullfil the passport, visa and other immigration requirements 
applicable to your itinerary. You should confirm these with the relevant embassies and/or 
consulates. We do not accept any responsibility in the case of you being unable to travel 
due to not complying with any such requirements.</p>
<p align="justify">
You are also required to carry a valid International Student I.D., and International Youth 
I.D. or an International Teacher I.D. card if you are traveling on a special student/youth/
teacher ticket. It is your responsibility to verify this with our travel expert who is assisting 
you.</p>

<strong>Insurance</strong>
<p align="justify">
Travel insurance is a vital part of your arrangements. We strongly recommend that you have 
taken out adequate insurance for the duration of your journey. Travel insurance is a mandatory
element of some travel arrangements. We may be able to arrange travel insurance to be provided 
to you, furnish you a quote, and answer any queries you may have regarding the insurance.<p>

<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
<p align="justify">
You consent to our processing and sharing of personal information about you and other members
